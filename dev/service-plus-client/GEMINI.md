- In planA.md write all the steps of execution as Step1, Step 2 and so on.
- In planA.md include a workflow section which provides the workflow of entire work.
- When creating a form never use red color for any control css. Red color will only be used for indicating errors.

- use pnpm and not npm
- use React Router + Redux Toolkit
- For global state management use redux
- When creating a form, the * for mandatory fields should be red color
- Keep all the messages and custom errors in a centralized sngle file as key values. Use the keys from this file to display any message including exception. Rule is any text longer than two words should stay in messages.ts. But keep all controls display text hard coded.

- For components, hooks and inline handlers use arrow functions
