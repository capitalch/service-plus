# Instructions
- I want to test zod and see its implementation along with react-hook-form and @hookform/resolvers
- Modify "Example Form" sidebar menu item to a modern looking menu item named as "Example Forms" with sumenus as "Customer Details", "Zod form"
- Implement a fairly complex form showing many validations of different types of data in Zod in the "Zod Form" submenu. It should clearly demonstrate various validations and typescript types validations
- Move existing Example Form to Customer Details submenu
